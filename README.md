# KIDS PLAY SOCCER

Are you a company or an individual that is looking to make a difference in the lives of children that come from low income families? Are you looking to lend a helping hand and be a role-model in these kiddos' lives? What better way to to help these kids enjoy their childhood, than to volunteer your time and be a soccer coach for these kiddos?  This would be a free for the kiddos to join, and a company can be the sponsor to pay for the soccer expenses for the team (uniforms, balls, waters, shoes, and socks), and another volunteer can sign up to put a team together and schedule the games.

## About the User 
- We were comissioned by the high lords of hip hop - the owners of HHPW - to create this application. Ideally, volunteers will authenticate through FireBase Auth, and utilize the pgAdmin database system to create/edit teams, players, and add players to teams, schedule a game between two teams, and delete any one of these entities. 

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- A CRUD application featuring persistent storage within a pgAdmin storage database. 
- Authenticated users can log in and CREATE: teams, players, and games.
- Authenticated users can READ: created teams as well as the players associated with them, players individually and as a whole, games.
